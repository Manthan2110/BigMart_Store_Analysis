# 🛍️ BigMart Store Data Analysis 📊  
*Making data-driven shopping decisions, so you don’t have to cry at your bank balance later! 💸*

## 🧠 Business Problem

Welcome to **BigMart**, where shopping meets science (or at least spreadsheets)!  
In 2022, BigMart ran a full-scale sales operation across India, with thousands of orders placed through various online platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio, and Nalli.

But...  
🤔 *Which customers shop the most?*  
💁 *Do women love kurta sets more than men love discounts?*  
📍 *Which state is the king of shopping?*  
We were hired by the analytics gods to find out.

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze BigMart's annual sales data and uncover:
- Best performing **months**, **states**, and **platforms** 🗓️📍🛒
- Buying behavior across **gender** and **age groups** 🚻👶🧓
- Conversion statuses like Delivered, Cancelled, Refunded, and more 🔄
- Sales distribution across channels and product categories 📦

## 🔍 Key Insights (A.K.A what the data screamed at us)

1. **Women > Men (in shopping, obviously)**  
   Women accounted for **₹1.35 Crores**, while men stopped at ₹76 Lakhs. Sorry bros!

2. **Amazon > Everyone Else**  
   Amazon leads with over ₹75 Lakhs in revenue, followed by Myntra and Flipkart.  
   Ajio and Nalli… uhh, thanks for participating 😅

3. **December is the Queen of Sales**  
   December saw the highest number of orders and revenue. Maybe everyone was buying gifts or coping with the year-end blues.

   Shoutout to Maharashtra for spending the most — nearly ₹30 Lakhs! 🎉
